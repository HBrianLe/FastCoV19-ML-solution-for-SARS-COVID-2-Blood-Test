## Objectives
This work has the objective to predict confirmed COVID-19 cases among suspected cases based on commonly
collected laboratory exams.
We consider the following question:
Based on the results of laboratory tests commonly collected for a suspected COVID-19 case during an annual
physical exam, would it be possible to predict the test result for SARS-Cov-2 (positive/negative)?
## Data Set
The dataset contains anonymized data from patients seen at the Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein in SÃ£o
Paulo, Brazil, and who had samples collected to perform the SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and additional laboratory
tests during a visit to the hospital.
